# Topic-modeling-Bertopic

## Introduction
This repository contains code for topic modeling using the SaudiNewsNet dataset. The topic modeling approach is based on the BERTopic library, as demonstrated in Abu Bakr Soliman's video tutorial and accompanying Colab notebook. I have adapted and modified the code for the SaudiNewsNet dataset after thorough understanding and research.

## Bertopic Steps:
BERTopic can be viewed as a sequence of steps to create its topic representations. There are
five steps to this process:

## Dataset
The SaudiNewsNet dataset consists of news articles from various sources related to Saudi Arabia. It covers a wide range of topics including politics, economy, culture, and more.

## Getting Started
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/saudinewsnet-topic-modeling.git
   ```
2. Download the SaudiNewsNet dataset and place it in the `data` directory.

## Usage
1. Run the `BERTopic-SaudiNewsNet.ipynb` notebook to perform topic modeling on the SaudiNewsNet dataset.
2. Modify the notebook as needed for experimentation and analysis.

## Results
The topic modeling results will be available in the notebook, showcasing the discovered topics and their respective keywords. Feel free to explore and interpret the results to gain insights into the themes present in the SaudiNewsNet dataset.
